# Mitzvah Mad Libs Mishkababbkle (MMM)

I built MMM because I remember how fun Madlibs were as a child. I made it suitable for Jewish children because I've noticed a lack of Jewish educational apps.

Next steps:

1. Improve the graphics (audio, more color, etc.). 
2. Ask the user to input different kinds of information (age, cities, numbers, adverbs, etc.)
3. Expand Mitzva List
4. Add animation to Mitzva Mishkababble button.
