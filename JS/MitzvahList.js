// Purim in Mexico

// Purim was always fun for “boy’s name.” He loved going to Shul to hear the “Mitzva1” be read and see all of his “noun1” from school. He especially loved “verb1” in a costume and seeing all of his friends' different costumes. This year, however, he was very sad because there was a “noun2” called Carona which made people “verb2” their own “noun3!” It was really “adj1” for “boy’s name.”

// Nevertheless, “boy’s name” knew that simcha poretz geder (“joy breaks boundaries”) so he decided to be happy. Right when he decided to be happy, he started to “verb3,”  which was very “adj2” to everyone watching. His mother told him, “boy’s name,” you must eat these “adj3” “Mitzva2” I baked for you! They are in the shape of Haman’s hat! “Then you can go with your father to give “Mitzva3”  to the needy -  HaShem wants everyone to be happy on Purim!”


// Rosh HaShana
// “Girls name” lived in “city name.”  Her family had lived there for “number” years. Her favorite holiday was Rosh HaShana because she was excited to start the new year. But this year, she would have to really “verb1” because her “noun1” was so “adj1.” 

// On top of that, she really wanted to “verb2,” but her brother’s “noun2” was always in the way! It was really “adj2” for her. 

// Even with these challenges, “Girl’s name” was still looking forward to dipping the “Mitzva2” in the “adj3” “noun3” to ask for a sweet new year. She also really wanted to hear the Rabbi blow the “Mitzva3” in shul. Hearing it always made her want to “verb3”
